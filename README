This program mines tons of data from twitter using Java and Redis (noSQL).

It listens to a stream of tweets and saves users'names and hashtags in a Redis database.
Some mining mathods provide informations about hidden social networks of #hashtags or @mentions 
and about users or hashtags similarity.

To run it you need to complete the file twitter4j.properties with your Twitter OAuth keys.

You also need to include:

- twitter4j-core-2.2.2.jar
- twitter4j-stream-2.2.2.jar
- jedis-2.0.0.jar
- commons-pool-1.5.6.jar

or later versions.
